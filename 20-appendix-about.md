# Colophon #

Almost all of the software that I have used in the creation of this
book are [FLOSS](#floss).

## Birth of the Book ##

In the first draft of this book, I had used Red Hat 9.0 Linux as the
foundation of my setup and in the sixth draft, I used Fedora Core 3
Linux as the basis of my setup.

Initially, I was using KWord to write the book (as explained in the
[history lesson](#history-lesson) in the preface).

## Teenage Years ##

Later, I switched to DocBook XML using Kate but I found it too
tedious. So, I switched to OpenOffice which was just excellent with
the level of control it provided for formatting as well as the PDF
generation, but it produced very sloppy HTML from the document.

Finally, I discovered XEmacs and I rewrote the book from scratch in
DocBook XML (again) after I decided that this format was the long term
solution.

In the sixth draft, I decided to use Quanta+ to do all the
editing. The standard XSL stylesheets that came with Fedora Core 3
Linux were being used. However, I had written a CSS document to give
color and style to the HTML pages. I had also written a crude lexical
analyzer, in Python of course, which automatically provides syntax
highlighting to all the program listings.

For the seventh draft, I'm using [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org)
as the basis of my setup. I used to edit everything online and the
readers can directly read/edit/discuss within the wiki website, but I
ended up spending more time fighting spam than writing.

## Now ##

For the eight draft, I used [Vim](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/vim),
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html), and Mac OS X.

Now I use
[Emacs 24.3](http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2013/03/11/whats-new-emacs-24-3/) +
[ghoseb's dotemacs](https://github.com/ghoseb/dotemacs) +
[Jason Blevins' Markdown Mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
which is a beautiful combination of software. As you may have
realized, I am quite happy with this editing setup.
